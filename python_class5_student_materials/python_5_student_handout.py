Read the contents of the existing to-do items
Add the new to do item to the existing to-do items

"""

# spreadsheet = # Add code to open the csv file
#
# heights = []
#
# for row in spreadsheet:
#     tree_height = row['height']
#     heights.append(tree_height)
#
# shortest_height = min(heights)
# print(shortest_height)




### EXERCISE 3 ###
