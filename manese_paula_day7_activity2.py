# 1. Create a calculator app
# 2. The user will choose between the
# 4 math operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide)
# 3. The application will ask for 2 numbers
# 4. Display the result
# 5. The application will ask againif the user wants to try again
# 6. Use the appropriate Exception (ex: Invalid input such as text and zero division)
